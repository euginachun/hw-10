# Let Me Flower One More Time

An interactive piece to bring awareness to Central American minors imprisoned in the US

## Summary

There are about couple hundred thousand Central American minors imprisoned in the US today. They are under strict US government custody and it is very hard for them to leave and people in public to know about them. They are nobody. When they turn 18, they are tranported directly into adult prisons. They don't have friends, family, or anyone that cares about them. The only thing they look foward to is to be granted a second chance in life. They don't wish for a "better" life, but a "less bad" one. When my H&S class professor, Claudia Bernardi was visiting these prisons - she asked one of the kids what he was drawing for the mural project. He was drawing a flower and titled it, "Let Me Flower One More Time." 

The main model of this piece will be a 3D printed model of a child laying down (in a mummy like position - to symbolize they are helpless and imprisoned). Like the operation board game where the player tries to salvage all the pieces from the body while trying not to touch the surrounding barrier, the audience will try to salvage flower petals from the body. When they collect all the petals onto a separate board, the board will light up and bloom a new flower. 

By replicating a famous child game(operation) into an art piece adults can interact with on a child's body, I hope to bring awareness to this issue. In doing so, I hope the audience is able to recognize the helpless, jailed, contained body. And the only way the kids can get a second chance in life (flower bloom) is when the exterior forces (audience) come into help and remove those burdens from their body because there's no other way for them. 

## Component Parts

- 3D print figure (with metal barriars around the holes?)(I have questions about the size)
- 3D print flower petals
- 3D print tweezers (with metal tip?)
- 3D print board for petals
- light
- Sensors to activate light and vibrations
